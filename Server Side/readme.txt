ChatCCGS Server Side by Ben Davison-Petch

Each script has a url that can be used to test it commented out at the top of the script. The url will access the live version of the server side stored in http://tartarus.ccgs.wa.edu.au/~1022309/cgibin/ChatCCGS this live version may be under maintenance.

Some scripts WILL edit the live database.

Some scripts’ testing URLs contain values that will not work (eg. Incorrect password, etc). These URLs are there for the system designer to debug with (Hey, that’s me!), not for the person going through. If you want to see the server side in action, use the functionality provided through the app.
